# ⏳ TempoX  
### The first perpetual DEX that trades the *moment*, not just the price.

> **Trade the Moment. Adapt to Time. React to Events.**

---

## 🔥 The Problem
Today’s perpetual DEXs treat all moments the same. But in real markets:
- Leverage held for 1 hour ≠ leverage held for 7 days
- Price before CPI ≠ price after CPI
- Risk during calm ≠ risk during black-swan events

Yet current protocols ignore **time** and **context** — leading to unfair liquidations and systemic fragility.

---

## 💡 The Solution
TempoX introduces three core innovations:

1. **Time-Decay Leverage**  
   Leverage automatically decreases over time to reduce long-term risk.

2. **Event-Driven Pricing**  
   Contract prices react to real-world events (Fed, CPI, DAO votes) via oracles.

3. **Risk Pulse Score**  
   Every position gets a health score → used to adjust funding rates fairly.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Chain**: Arbitrum (planned)
- **Oracle**: Chainlink Functions
- **Fee Model**: 0.1% in USDC/ETH (no native token at launch)
